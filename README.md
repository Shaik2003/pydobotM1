# pydobotM1
## This is the edited driver for Dobot M1 version of the original pydobot library intended for use with the Dobot Magician.

Here's what you need to do.

First install the pydobot libraries into the python environment you created.

```
$ pip install pydobot
```

Now, proceed to Lib -> site-packages -> pydobot within the python environment and replace the _dobot.py_ file with the one present here in the repository. 

All new functions added are described in the _demo.py_ in the repo. I have yet to work on the range limits of the speed of the arm though. 

Have fun!!
